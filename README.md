# Turn ComfyUI Pipelines into APIs

[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) is a powerful tool for designing advanced diffusion pipelines. However, once the pipelines are built, deploying and serving them as API endpoints can be challenging and not very straightforward.

Recognizing the complexity of ComfyUI, [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) provides a non-intrusive solution to serve existing ComfyUI pipelines as APIs without requiring any pipeline rewrites. It also offers the flexibility to customize the API endpointâ€™s schema and logic.

This repository contains a collection of example ComfyUI pipelines that can be deployed to the cloud as APIs using BentoML. Refer to each directory for detailed instructions.
